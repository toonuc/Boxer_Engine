Part 2: Synthesis - 2D Animation

The following animation demonstrates the 180-degree phase offset of the boxer engine mechanism. The dashed lines represent the stroke path, and the circle represents the crankshaft path.

Part 3: Symbolic Math Analysis

Using the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox, we derived the exact equations for Position, Velocity, Acceleration, and Inertial Force. The results are plotted below:
